# jsonresume-theme-zurb

Lot of JSONresume themes out there using bootsrtap, thought I would try one with the Foundation framework.  Did use jsonresume and zurb foundation for emails (inky) to generate a resume suitable to send as an email.

Still lot of work to do before it is a proper jsonresume-theme.

## TO DO
- [x] Transform to traditional JSON Resume theme build ... index.js ...
- [x] Use CDN instead of stylesheets/js linked to dist/assets
